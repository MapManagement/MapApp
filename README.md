# MapApp
Small Android application written in Kotlin. Intention is to create
a programm that helps you to learn vocabularies or any other stuff
you can think off in a "Question - Answer" form. I'm sorry for my 
weird looking code and structure, first time building an app.
# Ideas
- swipe gestures instead of buttons
- creating new "learning files" inside the app -> reached
- editing already created files -> reached
- import and export files to share them with others
- IOS support?
