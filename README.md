# MapApp
Small Android application written in Kotlin. Intention is to create a programm that helps you to learn vocabularies or any other stuff you can think off in a "Question - Answer" form.
# Ideas
- swipe gestures instead of buttons
- creating new "learning files" inside the app -> reached
- editing already created files
- import and export files to share them with others
- IOS support?
